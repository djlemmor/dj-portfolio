                  schemes. Additionally, I converted existing flash files and

                  I have been involved in various projects that encompassed
                  different aspects of web development. In the first project, I
                  took over and maintained an existing live website built with
                  the Codeigniter 3 framework. Throughout this role, I
                  implemented numerous enhancements to meet the specific needs
                  and goals of the client. In the second project, I played a
                  significant role in creating the admin dashboard, utilizing
                  Vue.js on the frontend and Laravel on the backend. This
                  involved designing and developing the dashboard to provide an
                  intuitive user interface for administrative tasks. In the
                  third project, I participated in the creation of both the
                  marketplace and the admin dashboard for a website based on a
                  Figma design. Vue.js and Element Plus, a Vue 3 based component
                  library, were utilized in this project to bring the design to
                  life. I converted the Figma design into Vue components,
                  ensuring a faithful representation of the original design
                  while incorporating interactive functionality. These
                  experiences have allowed me to gain expertise in both frontend
                  and backend technologies, such as Vue.js, Laravel, and
                  Codeigniter, enabling me to contribute effectively to web
                  development projects.

                  I was responsible for developing a microservice architecture
                  by creating an API using Laravel framework. This involved
                  implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to
                  interact with both MSSQL and Oracle databases. I successfully
                  designed and built the API endpoints, allowing seamless data
                  manipulation and retrieval from these databases. Throughout
                  the project, I ensured the proper handling of database
                  connections, query execution, and error handling.
